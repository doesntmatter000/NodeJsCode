A 60 second intro followed by nearly 7 hours of code and instruction for Node JS to help you start from scratch and level up. I bookmarked all 15 chapters in the description. If you complete one lesson per day, you'll complete the full course in two weeks. Post questions in the comments below. ⬇⬇⬇ If you are new to Javascript, you should start with my full 8 hour Javascript course tutorial here: https://youtu.be/EfAl9bwzVZk
